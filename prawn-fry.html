        <h3>Steps to make Prawn fry:</h3>
        
            <ul>Clean and devein the prawns wash them well with water and drain the excess water. In a bowl, add the prawns. It is always a better idea to drain off the excess water in prawns when washed by allowing them to sit in a strainer for a while.</ul>
            
            <ul>Add salt to taste as per the requirement</ul>
            <ul>Add ginger-garlic paste. Freshly homemade ginger garlic paste is best as it gives the best aroma and flavour.</ul>
            <ul>Add red chilli powder and turmeric powder.
            </ul>
            <ul>Add roasted coriander seeds powder.</ul>
            <ul>Mix the whole mixture well so that the prawns get coated well with the masala.</ul>
            <ul>Take a frying wok, add oil and heat it.</ul>
            <ul>Add the prawns into the heated oil.
            </ul>
            <ul>Stir the mixture well with the oil and stir it delicately.
            </ul>
            <ul>Add fresh curry leaves into the cooking prawns.</ul>
            <ul>Cook the prawns for about 10 -15 minutes and give a stir in between.
            </ul>
            <ul>Garnish it with coriander leaves</ul>
<ul>Thats all..</ul>
